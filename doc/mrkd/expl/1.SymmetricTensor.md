# Symmetric tensors


```julia
using TensorDec
```

We consider symmetric tensors or equivalently homogeneous polynomials, in the following variables:


```julia
X = @ring x0 x1 x2;
```

A symmetric tensor of order d=4 and of rank 3.


```julia
d=4; F = (x0+x1+0.75x2)^d + 1.5*(x0-x1)^d -2.0*(x0-x2)^d
```




    0.5x0^4 - 2.0x0^3x1 + 11.0x0^3x2 + 15.0x0^2x1^2 + 9.0x0^2x1x2 - 8.625x0^2x2^2 - 2.0x0x1^3 + 9.0x0x1^2x2 + 6.75x0x1x2^2 + 9.6875x0x2^3 + 2.5x1^4 + 3.0x1^3x2 + 3.375x1^2x2^2 + 1.6875x1x2^3 - 1.68359375x2^4



The graph of the homogeneous polynomial ``(x0+x1+0.75x2)^4 + 1.5(x0-x1)^4 -2(x0-x2)^4`` in polar coordinates on the sphere looks like this:

We associate to ``t``, the following (truncated) series in the dual variables, after substituting ``x0`` by 1:

Computing its decomposition


```julia
w, Xi = decompose(F);
```

yields the weights `w`


```julia

and the corresponding points `Xi`, which are the coefficient vectors of `x0, x1, x2` in the linear forms of the decomposition of the tensor F. They are normalized to have norm 1:
