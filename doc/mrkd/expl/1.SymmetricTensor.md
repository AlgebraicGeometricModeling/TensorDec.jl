```julia
using TensorDec
```

We consider symmetric tensors or equivalently homogeneous polynomials, in the following variables:


```julia
X = @ring x0 x1 x2;
```

A symmetric tensor of order d=4 and of rank 3.


```julia
d=4; F = (x0+x1+0.75x2)^d + 1.5*(x0-x1)^d -2.0*(x0-x2)^d
```




0.5x0^{4} - 2.0x0^{3}x1 + 11.0x0^{3}x2 + 15.0x0^{2}x1^{2} + 9.0x0^{2}x1x2 - 8.625x0^{2}x2^{2} - 2.0x0x1^{3} + 9.0x0x1^{2}x2 + 6.75x0x1x2^{2} + 9.6875x0x2^{3} + 2.5x1^{4} + 3.0x1^{3}x2 + 3.375x1^{2}x2^{2} + 1.6875x1x2^{3} - 1.68359375x2^{4}



The graph of the homogeneous polynomial $(x_0+x_1+0.75x_2)^4 + 1.5(x_0-x_1)^4 -2(x_0-x_2)^4$ in polar coordinates on the sphere looks like this:

We associate to $t$, the following (truncated) series in the dual variables, after substituting $x_0$ by 1:

Computing its decomposition


```julia
w, Xi = decompose(F);
```

yields the weights `w`


```julia
w
```




    3-element Array{Float64,1}:

and the corresponding points $\Xi$, which are the coefficient vectors of $x_0, x_1, x_2$ in the linear forms of the decomposition of the tensor F. They are normalized to have norm 1:
